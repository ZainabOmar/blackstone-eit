#  BlackStone-eIt Task ~~ 

The task was really helpful for me to learn new things, thanks for the chance.

I would like to point for one thing:

In page1, the items inside the square were taken from the same photos that were sent to me.
By taking screen shot for the item ONLY, and resizing it using css, the reason is that I couldn't find the items as icons in font-awesome or bootstrap libraries or as html unicode.
